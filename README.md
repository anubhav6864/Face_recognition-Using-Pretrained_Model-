## Face_recognition-Using-Pretrained_Model-
Its a simple model on Face-Recognition using a pre-trained model.

Packges Used:-

import cv2

import face_recognition

from skimage.feature import hog:- 
The histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection. The technique counts occurrences of gradient orientation in localized portions of an image.

from skimage import data,exposure

from matplotlib.patches import Rectangle

from matplotlib.patches import Circle

from scipy.spatial import distance

### In this pretrained encoder provided in the Face_recognition package is used.
